# PropCloud.io

## Project Overview and Context

PropCloud.io is an autonomous property management platform for short-term rental hosts. Our solution automates sales, operations, and guest communications to help hosts save time and increase revenue. PropCloud.io is currently in waitlist mode, so we'll need both a public-facing landing page with waitlist functionality and a user dashboard for comprehensive property management automation once we launch. Our target audience is small to mid-sized property managers handling 5-50 properties who are looking to scale efficiently through automation.

## Technology Preferences

We have Google Cloud credits, so please prioritize Google Cloud services when possible:
- Google Cloud Firestore for database
- Firebase Authentication
- Google Cloud Storage
- Google Cloud Run or App Engine for hosting

For the front-end, please use modern frameworks and libraries that enable a responsive, professional design.

## Development Process

Please build this project in a step-by-step manner, thoroughly testing and saving progress after completing each component before moving to the next one. This will ensure we have working modules throughout development.
